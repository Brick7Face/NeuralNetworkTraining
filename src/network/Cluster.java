/*	Cluster represents a cluster of data points. It has a center and a list of members, as well as a pheromone value for
 * 	ACO. There are are a number of clusters that can be created, as is shown below. Essentially, the user can create
 *	a cluster with as little or much information as they have. A cluster can return its members and center, and add points,
 *	update the center, and get and set pheromone levels.
